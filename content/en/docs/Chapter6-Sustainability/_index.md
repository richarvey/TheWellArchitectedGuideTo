  The Sustainability pillar focuses on environmental impacts, especially energy consumption and efficiency, since they are important levers for architects to inform direct action to reduce resource usage.

Sustainability is a new pillar introduced in December 2021 and asks us as developers/engineers/architects/operations to think about the resources we are using, For example, do you need to run a server that offers uploads 24x7 when uploads only happen in business hours, if you don’t need it, automate its shutdown and start-up. You’ll also find that this has a pleasant effect on the cost optimization pillar due to the pay-for-what-you-use model of AWS.
