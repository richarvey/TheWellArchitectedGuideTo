Welcome to the first book in the "Well-Architected Guide" series, which brings you a collection of features and articles created for this series and some adapted from the AWS documentation and blogs. I'd like to say a big thank you to all who have supported me whilst I've created this completion of guides and howto's that help you use S3 in a Well-Architected way. We'll work our way through the 6 pillars of the well-architected framework with recipes you can try out for yourself to help your standing when scoring your AWS Well-Architected Review.
