## Who is this book for?

This book is for people who know the basics of AWS and Amazon S3 but want to make sure they are using it in the best possible way, a way that adheres to the six pillars of the well-architected framework of best practices. There are a few tips and tricks in here even for the more experienced practitioners.

## What can you get from this book?

This book will guide you round some of the best practices around using Amazon S3 and hopefully help you discover it's much much more than just sa simple storage service, I'm a self confessed S3 fanboy and hopefully this book will share my enthusiasum with you.
