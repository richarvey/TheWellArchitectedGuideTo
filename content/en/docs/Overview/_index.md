## Who is this book for?

This book is for people who know the basics of AWS and Amazon S3 but want to make sure they are using it in the best possible way, a way that adheres to the six pillars of the well-architected framework of best practices. There are a few tips and tricks in here even for the more experienced practitioners.
I’ll guide you through the best practices for security and show you how to save money on common tasks. We’ll look at static web hosting, offloading static assets from your CMS and much much more as we go. One of my favourite integrations with S3 is the ability to automate actions after a file has been uploaded with Lambda.

## What can you get from this book?

This book will guide you round some of the best practices around using Amazon S3 and hopefully help you discover it's much much more than just a simple storage service, I'm a self confessed S3 fanboy and hopefully this book will share my enthusiasum with you. You'll learn how to secure your workloads and host a website that can take an impressive amount of load!
